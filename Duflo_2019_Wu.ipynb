    "Duflo et al. (2019) examine the effects of Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV (VCT) and increasing access to male condoms compared to standard available HIV prevention services, using biological and behavioral outcomes, among youth in Western Kenya. VCT, serving as the entry to HIV treatment and care, is a test of accessing one’s HIV serostatus, in addition to receiving individualized risk-reduction counseling. VCT is supposed to help individuals reduce risky sexual behaviors and prevent themselves and their partners from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections such as Herpes Simplex Type 2 (HSV-2). Even though some of the previous studies show the reduction of risky sexual behavior in testing-positive individuals, other studies bring about the concern of disinhibition among those testing negative (Sherr et al. 2007). \n",

In total, they represent 85% of aged 17 - 24 in 2009 western Kenya. \n",

    "# 3. Identification Problems\n",
    "---\n",
    "Considering Duflo et al. (2019) do not obtain any significant result, it might be more suitable to discuss possible identification problems in this section instead of identification. I am not trying to suggest obtaining significant result means problem-free, it just doesn’t seem meaningful to discuss how their identifications work in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Selection bias**\n",
    "As a randomized control trial, this estimation is supposed to be free from selection bias. Nevertheless, in study design, Duflo et al. (2019) mention that the sample is based on its previous study which restricts the participants of this study to those who have attended at least 6 grade and accepting HIV related knowledges. Considering the following model from Greene (2006): \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "yi = xi' \\beta + ei\\\\\n",
    "zi^* = wi' \\gamma + ui\\\\\n",
    "zi = 1(zi^* > c)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Where $yi$ is our outcome variable. $xi$ is the treatment group. $zi$ is attending grade 6 or not. wi is are exogenous factors decided to attend 6 grade or not. $ei, ui$ are error terms.\n",
    "Then we can rewrite the function into:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E(yi|wi, ui) = xi' \\beta + E(ei|wi, ui)\\\\\n",
    " = xi' \\beta + E(ei|ui)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "For $E(ei|ui)$ not equals to zero, we might obtain a biased estimator. And such an example is easily thinking of, for example, children from poverty background may be more likely to drop out, and higher chance to become sex worker, can't afford to buy condoms, missing sex education in class are all factors that could increase their chance of getting STI. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the latter discussion, the authors do not bring about this issue, but do admit lower external validity, while stressing as HIV prevention scaled up, increasing population would have access to prevention information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Measure error from self report**\n",
    "Because of the behavioral outcomes are acquired through surveys, one common problem from self-reported is the imprecision of the data, possibly resulting from causes such as forgetfulness or deception. \n",
    "considering models from Hansen (2020):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "yi = \\beta xi^* + ui\\\\\n",
    "\\textrm{where} \\quad E[ui|xi^*] = 0\\\\\n",
    "xi = xi^* + vi\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Where $yi$ is one of our outcome variables, $xi$ is reported behavior, $ui$ is the error term, and vi are deviation originated from forgetfulness or deception.\n",
    "rewritten the function as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "yi = \\beta xi^* + ui\\\\\n",
    "\\textrm{where} \\quad ei = -\\beta vi + ui\\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Then we can get the covariance of our treatment and residual is the variance of this reporting mistake. As we need $xi$ and residual to be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I would say measurement error has limited influence in this case. Only a few behavior problems serving as independent variables, for example ever pregnant and school enrollment in 2007 and is theoretically possible to do fact checks on these two variables. Most of the behavioral outcomes are serving as dependent variables in the logistic regression stated at section 4, in which case affect our estimation much lesser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Externalty**\n",
    "One intriguing question to ask is whether these treatments induce externality, Miguel, Edward, and Kremer (2004) finds out in a randomized trial on 75 Kenya primary schools that medical treatment for intestinal helminths in the treatment group also reducing the transmission within the control group, even their randomized trial is taking place across schools. Using male condoms would undoubtedly reduce the possibility of infecting sex partners and thus contaminate the obtaining result. If the subject having any behavioral change after receiving VCT, it’ll also affect their sexual partners. Such an externality exists hinder us to detach treatment effects from the treatment group. I haven’t found any paper having empirical evidence on how would externality affecting HIV research, but some of the papers point this out and try to discuss the possible influence, such as Canning D. (2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<span style=\"color:orange\">**NOTE**:</span> the  model used in this paper is logistic regression while I use linear notations in section 3 for simplicity. For nonlinear model, endogeneity and externality are still problems that affect large sample property of estimators which have an in-depth discussion in _A Logit Model With Endogenous Explanatory Variables and Network Externalities_ ( de Grange et al. 2015)"

In a meta-analysis (Fonner 2012 et al.) summing up 17 studies, it appears that no significant changes in STI or HIV prevalence rate of those receiving VCT. However, to who being test positive for HIV, there is a reduction in sex partners and an increase in condom use. This cannot be assessed in our data due to overly low HIV prevalence.\n",

Another multi-component HIV prevention program conducted in Africa and Thailand suggests there is a significant reduction among older women, but no effect among ages 18 to 24 (Coates 2014 et al.). In this study, the subjects are between 17 to 24, which is consistent with their finding.\n",
