    "Duflo et al. (2019) examine the effects of Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV (VCT) and increasing access to male condoms compared to standard available HIV prevention services, using biological and behavioral outcomes, among youth in Western Kenya. VCT, serving as the entry to HIV treatment and care, is a test of accessing one’s HIV serostatus, in addition to receiving individualized risk-reduction counseling. VCT is supposed to help individuals reduce risky sexual behaviors and prevent themselves and their partners from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections such as Herpes Simplex Type 2 (HSV-2). Even though some of the previous studies show the reduction of risky sexual behavior in testing-positive individuals, other studies bring about the concern of disinhibition among those testing negative (Sherr et al. 2007). \n",

    "Through a four-arm, unblinded, individually randomized controlled trial implemented between 2009 and 2012 in four districts of Kenya’s Western Province, including samples of 10,245 youth aged 17 to 24 randomly assigned to receive community-based VCT, 150 male condoms, both VCT and condoms, or neither program, Duflo et al. (2019) examine the effect of these two interventions among the youth. The result suggests there are no statistically significant effects on the risk of HIV, or other behavioral or knowledge outcomes including self-reported pregnancy rates.\n",

    "There are standard VCT available to everyone at local health facilities, however, the intervention provided in the trial within community lowering travel time and cost, and social cost of visiting a HIV testing center. For the condom intervention arm, participants were provided 150 male condoms, they could take all or only of these condoms.\n",

    "#### **Selection bias**\n",
    "As a randomized control trial, this estimation is supposed to be free from selection bias. Nevertheless, in study design, Duflo et al. (2019) mention that the sample is based on its previous study which restricts the participants of this study to those who have attended at least 6 grade and accepting HIV related knowledges. Considering the following model from Greene (2006): \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "yi = xi' \\beta + ei\\\\\n",
    "zi^* = wi' \\gamma + ui\\\\\n",
    "zi = 1(zi^* > c)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Where $yi$ is our outcome variable. $xi$ is the treatment group. $zi$ is attending grade 6 or not. wi is are exogenous factors decided to attend 6 grade or not. $ei, ui$ are error terms.\n",
    "Then we can rewrite the function into:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E(yi|wi, ui) = xi' \\beta + E(ei|wi, ui)\\\\\n",
    " = xi' \\beta + E(ei|ui)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "For $E(ei|ui)$ not equals to zero, we might obtain a biased estimator. And such an example is easily thinking of, for example, children from poverty background may be more likely to drop out, and higher chance to become sex worker, can't afford to buy condoms, missing sex education in class are all factors that could increase their chance of getting STI. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the latter discussion, the authors do not bring about this issue, but do admit lower external validity, while stressing as HIV prevention scaled up, increasing population would have access to prevention information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Measure error from self report**\n",
    "Because of the behavioral outcomes are acquired through surveys, one common problem from self-reported is the imprecision of the data, possibly resulting from causes such as forgetfulness or deception. \n",
    "considering models from Hansen (2020):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "yi = \\beta xi^* + ui\\\\\n",
    "\\textrm{where} \\quad E[ui|xi^*] = 0\\\\\n",
    "xi = xi^* + vi\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Where $yi$ is one of our outcome variables, $xi$ is reported behavior, $ui$ is the error term, and vi are deviation originated from forgetfulness or deception.\n",
    "rewritten the function as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

Using male condoms would undoubtedly reduce the possibility of infecting sex partners and thus contaminate the obtaining result. If the subject having any behavioral change after receiving VCT, it’ll also affect their sexual partners. Such an externality exists hinder us to detach treatment effects from the treatment group. I haven’t found any paper having empirical evidence on how would externality affecting HIV research, but some of the papers point this out and try to discuss the possible influence, such as Canning D. (2006).\n",

However, to who being test positive for HIV, there is a reduction in sex partners and an increase in condom use. This cannot be assessed in our data due to overly low HIV prevalence.\n",

(2019) and is not the same as how the paper described as well. In the paper, it mentioned about blood testing, instead of self-reporting as the source of HSV-2 infection.\n",
